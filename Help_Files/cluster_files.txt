This is a guide to help me remember what I have done and the explanation/results

Naming guide: Try to name files with important variables and an ID 
SLiM - variable names/values separated with _ and the ID of the slim simulation
MSprime - variable names/values separated with _ (need to add ID)

CLUSTER FILES: which. I can now access though VS code

Expdata/ Place to hold the data from each of my experiments 
Will always have tree files and text files and will be renamed as I do different experiments 
this is like a motif 

findparams/ a folder where I run tests to see if the mu and effect size I choose will create newts 
    and snakes with phenotypes under 2 or under 5. It is alo where I tested adding the SD values and the plotting
msprime_test_sim/ folder conting msprime test simulations - no longer use
/no_sd/ slim test and tree files before I recorded the SD
/sd_test/ slim test and tree files once I recording the SD
/u2/ msprime files, slim test and tree files, for testing 3 parmiters for phenotype for under 2
this experiment worked really well. Most phenotypes were under 2 the r docs find_params and narmal_sim shows it well
I used these files to make the pictures in plotting/
/u2_1000000/ msprime files, slim test and tree files, for testing 1 set of parmiters for phenotype for under 2 for 100000 gens
Need to test still 8/17/2021. 
/u5/ msprime files, slim test and tree files, for testing 3 parmiters for phenotype for under 5
this experiment worked really well. Most phenotypes were under 5 the r docs find_params and narmal_sim shows it well
I used these files to make the pictures in plotting/

MSprime_script/ Where the files to run MSprime simulation lives
/job_out/ place where the output and the errs go from jobs (its too larger now, dump? or fix?)
msprime1000.srun - making the srun for the 1000 gen test, the output is going to MSprome_sim_1000
msprimefindparams.srun - this is where I created the findparams folder and ran the msprime files
msprimeloop.srun - loops though variables and calls another script to run the simulation
runmsprime.srun - runs the msprime simulation
snake_newt_gv_.py - simulates past mutations for newts and snakes

MSprome_sim/ Place where all of the MSprime simulations will go
- notes will need to add additional folders for specific experiments and random IDs at the end of names
- will want to cycle though these files and parse out important variables (parsing.sh) 
/small_1000/ this is the msprime simulations for the 12 starting points for the 1000 gen project
/used_for_test_or_1000_gen/ msprime simulations for testing and the first sections of the 1000 gen project

MSprome_sim_1000/ Place where the MSprime 1000gen simulations will go 
each one of these was used in just one slim simulation (with the same corresponding values)

Old_1000_try/
/pheno_test_1000/ txt files and tress files to see what the phenotypes are after 1000 generations
This test was done with a specific MSprime simulation both_su_1e-10_nu_1e-10_sue_0.01_nue_0.01.init.trees
Next step clean slim text data and graph
/pheno_test_1000_2/ txt files and tress files to see what the phenotypes are after 1000 generations
This test was done different MSprime simulations 
Next step clean slim text data and graph

peter_sug_1000/ this is just a slight change in the 1on1 slim script 7/19/2021
Peter made a suggestion for how to do the mutation rate for newts and snakes and total
I am rerunning the 12 msprime and 143 slim simulations to see how the results differ.

pheno_test_1000/ t files and tress files to see what the phenotypes are after 1000 generations for the simulations with different msprimes
BUT I couldn't tell them apart so I redid the experiment in a new folder -> pheno_test_1000_12

pheno_test_1000_12/ txt files and tress files to see what the phenotypes are after 1000 generations for the simulations with different msprimes
a little bit more than 1000 different simulations. 143 slim simulations for 12 msprime simulations

pheno_test_1000_cut/ this is where the "cut" files go.
I just wanted a place to hold all the data after I got rid of the extra text
thinking about deleting it
mostly a copy of the experiments that I ran
/findparams/ files from the find param experiments 3 for each set of parameter
/findparams_no_sd/ files from the find param experiments 3 for each set of parameter befor I added the sd
/indparams_u2/ files from the find param experiments except I didnt have something in the slim title making the connection between the files difficult to make
/findparams_u2_100000/ text files from the u2 100000gen experiment
/indparams_u2_new/ files from the find param experiments where everthing is connected for phenotype under 2
/indparams_u5/ files from the find param experiments except I didnt have something in the slim title making the connection between the files difficult to make
/indparams_u5_new/ files from the find param experiments where everthing is connected for phenotype under 5
/peter_sug_1000/ files from peters slim suggestions 
/text_files/ files from the 12 msprime simulation that were unidentifiable 
/text_files_12/ files from the 12 msprime simulation that were identifiable 

plotting/ A folder to contain the r scripts that I will use specfically for plotting 
/u2_figs/ folder that containf the distribution (spatial and phenotype) for the slim reslts for a phenotype under 2
- looking at them if one species starts out ahead of the other then they stay ahead. The ditribution is normal looking
/u5_figs/ folder that containf the distribution (spatial and phenotype) for the slim reslts for a phenotype under 5
- looking at them if one species starts out ahead of the other then they stay ahead. The ditribution has a long tail (tail is on the larger phenotype)
distrinution.srun - this is a masterpiece that uses grep to connect all 3 files (msprime, slim trees, slim text) to make plots in r (it is a pipeline)
space_assemble.R - this is the r file that takes 4 parameters to make 6 distribution plots

SLiM_script/ has the 1 on 1 slim script. Where I was testing mutation rate and effect size.
/job_out/ place where the output and the errs go from jobs (its too larger now, dump? or fix?)
data_cut - makes new folders and sut out the extra info from slim scrips
newt_snake_1on1_100000.slim - 2d newt on snake, no deleterious mutations or fitness cost stops at 100000 gens
newt_snake_1on1.slim - 2d newt on snake, no deleterious mutations or fitness cost stops at 1000 gens
parsing_1000_small.srun - for and a while loop that goes through a file and runs the parameters from a csv while using the all the msprime simulations from a folder (must include the folder when running)
parsing.srun - pulling out values from names of a folder
pheno_test_1000.srun - calls the slim script with variables given from a file <- I made this to see what the phenotypes are after 1000 generations
pulll_ind_info.slim - will pull the phenotypes and locations of newts and snakes for the 1st and 1000th generation with the slim tree and sprime file (must include the seed)
runslim_100000.srun - runs the slim 100000 script with the variables passed through a different script
runslim.srun - runs the slim script with the variables passed through a different script (one of the most used files)
slim_test_script.srun - file to run just one test file to check if slim & other stuff is working
slimloop.srun - loops through variables and calls another script to run the slim script
slimtestvarables_short.csv - place for the variables that I wish to test condensed version
slimtestvarables.csv - place for the variables that I wish to test all possible combinations
testslim.srun - another file to telt what is happening with the slim file. one of them wasnt working last time I checked.....

test_slim/ folder that has all of the slim test reslts (just seeing id the slim script is working NOT data to use)
