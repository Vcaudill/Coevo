This is a guide to help me remember what I have done and the explanation/results

Naming guide: Try to name files with important variables and an ID 
SLiM - variable names/values separated with _ and the ID of the slim simulation
MSprime - variable names/values separated with _ (need to add ID)

GIT/MY FILES:

data/ <- will never be pushed to git
newts_annotated.init.trees - dealing with trying to annotate the newts 
slimtestvarables_short -  short version for speficic testing the 12 starts 
slimtestvarables.csv  - contains the variables for the 1000 gens experiment 
csv_files/ large_eff/ sigma/ size/ 2d_size/ Contains the data from the matching phenotypes 3rd rotation experiment 
test/ files to test slim with 

figures/ that I used in my rotation talks to explain how similar the two populations were

graphs_newt_snakes/ r markdown files to show the results from the newt snake experiment
Expected_results_fig.Rmd - proposal expected results (might have some good graph info) 
fig_1000.Rmd - this is the r markdown for the 1000 generation experiment. As of 7/7/2021 there are 3 experiments (mistake experiment, experiment 1 and two simulation experiment)
    there are some question I have about the slim and msprim script, like why do the newts start out higher? I will look into the msprime and sslim script to see what might be going on
	As of 7/14/2021 There has been a forth experiment added. This experiment is called the 12 starting points and is explained in detal on the r markdown file
find_params.Rmd - After the 1000 generation experiment Peter and I did some math to see if the phenotypes I got were expected
	Spoiler: They were! Now (7/19/2021) I am looking at what parameters will result in phenotypes around 2 or 5 (findparams folder on the cluster)
	In this markdown I write out the math that will determine what the phenotypes for newts and snakes are ment to start at.
	I plotted the diffent combinations that could result in the expected phenotypes and choose 6 to test (3 uner 2 and 3 under 5) 
	This mathmatical formual worked as expected! Here you can see the mean and sd of the phenotypes change with each generation
	The SD increases as the number of generations increased. Sometimes the mean phenotype increased. This lead me to think about what a normal simulation might look like 
narmal_sim.Rmd - ah spelling. This is an R markdown that trys to show what a normal slimulation might look like for the 1on1 newts.
	I run about 110 simulations (both msprime and slim) and found that newts and snakes strart off with a higher phenotype about half the time (good)
	Varration between the mean phenotypes was about the same for newts annd snakes (increased as generations increased)
	Phenotypes of newts and snakes increased over time.
	The difference between the newt and snake phenotype remained near 0 (the phenotype of one of the species is not exploiding) yay!
	Very similar things were seen for both the under 5 and under 2
	- One thing that concerned me is that in all 6 sets of simulations there were more simulations were newts started off with a higher phenotype. Why is that?
	To answer this I looked at the distributions of the newt and snake phenotypes and the locations of the newts and snakes
space_assemble.R - the shorted version of the r markdown (Space_display.Rmd) to run in my assembole line to look at the distibutions of newts and snakes
Space_display.Rmd - this rmarkdown looks at the location and phenotype of individulas in the 1st and 1000th generation. (2 version; 1 were I look at the alpha by phenotype and one version were I look at percentages to the max)
	It also looks at the phenotype distibutions for the 1st and 1000 generation
	We ran this for all of the findparams simulations to see that the newts and snakes were not avoiding each other.
		The pictures look good. But the species thats starts with an advantage seems to keep their advantage. Is this due to drift or selection? more test to come

Help_Files/ Files like this one for the different directories and scripts and experiments that I do!
cluster_files.txt -  just what is on the cluser. I needed to mave it to its own file to help with organization
explanation.txt - this file (1000 generation focused my split into 3 files for cluster/git/experiments) and now there are even more expeiments!

msprime/ the genetic variation simulations
snake_newt_gv_.py <- making the standing genetic variation for the slim script for both the newt and the snake
newt_gen_diversity.py <- making the standing genetic variation for the newt
snake_gen_diversity.py <- making the standing genetic variation for the snake
merge_snake_newt.py <- combining the stand alones into one file (many problems currently 6/18/21)
test_snake_newt_msprime.py<- same thing as snake_newt_gv_.py but for testing the pipeline 

msprime_explore/ figuring out how to make msprime work
	 
newt_snake/ <- my slim scripts about coevoultion
/data/ <- tree files produced from slim while in testing mode (will not be on git)
//space_test/ <- files that i used in the rmarkdown Space_display 
newt_snake_1on1.slim - newt on snake coevolution in 2d 
newt_vs_snake.slim - trial that I dont really use any more
nospace.slim - slim coevolution simulation without space
pull_ind_info.slim - used a msprime and slim tree file to recretate the locations and phenotypes of individulas
test_case_1.txt - saved info from pull_ind_info.slim

python_script/ many of these scripts are for tests and animating the bias mig ancestry  
python_test.py - testing the exponential and normal distributions 
ofspring_by_ind.py - solved the problem of children being miss-counted (WORKING WELL) 
ofspring_percentage.py - makes the circles more even (WORKING WELL) 
whyTypeError.py - figuring out why there is this error
tv_path_percentage.py - trying to caculate the paths but something is wrong
offspring_through_time.py - finding the number of offspring though time dots got larger as the number off offspring grew (something not right)
offspring_links.py - finding the links between individuals 
split_offsring_tt.py - did this the hard way with loops tring to find all of the kids of parents, much better to make and fill a matrix
animat_scatter.py - test for animation dots move and change sizes 
treesee.py - first attempt at animating and would get infinite loops (do not run)
curious.py - made a short video of 100 generations with all of the individuals in the simulation lines traced the location of individuals from 1 individual PC 

R_script/ these are to make the figures for the rotation talk they do have the name split information that i will use for my newts and snakes

slim_script/ scriptss from summer 2020 when i was first learning about coevoultion

EXPERIMENTS: 

Current:
newt_snake_1on1.slim leads to giant phenotype levels like millions to 0s 6/10/21
- Is this because of space or the interaction. Possibly both?
- Try to make a slim script with no space (nospace.slim) 6/18/21 NPH
- Try to make a slim script with no coevolution
- Try to make a slim script with no space and no coevolution
Potential solutions:
- Deleterious mutations 
- Add fitness cost

1000 Generation experiment aims to identify why some of the phenotypes seems to be extreme 
- 1 msprime with switched mu and sd for 143 slim simulations
- 1 msprime with corrected mu and sd for 143 slim simulations
- 1 msprime for each slim simulation (each parameter values match in both simulations)
- 12 starting points. There are 12 msprime simulations where each of these simulations will used to start 143 slim simulations (note Newts and Snakes will start off equally)
- Peters slim suggestion (fix the total mutation rate and took at the ratio) - currently running

GOALS:
- Learn how to use snakemake
- Rest after teaching
