This is a guide to help me remember what I have done and the explanation/results

Naming guide: Try to name files with important variables and an ID 
SLiM - variable names/values separated with _ and the ID of the slim simulation
MSprime - variable names/values separated with _ (need to add ID)

CLUSTER FILES: which. I can now access though VS code

Expdata/ Place to hold the data from each of my experiments 
Will always have tree files and text files and will be renamed as I do different experiments 
this is like a motif 

MSprime_script/ Where the files to run MSprime simulation lives
/job_out/ place where the output and the errs go from jobs (its too larger now, dump? or fix?)
snake_newt_gv_.py - simulates past mutations for newts and snakes
msprimeloop.srun - loops though variables and calls another script to run the simulation
runmsprime.srun - runs the msprime simulation
msprime1000.srun - making the srun for the 1000 gen test, the output is going to MSprome_sim_1000

MSprome_sim/ Place where all of the MSprime simulations will go
- notes will need to add additional folders for specific experiments and random IDs at the end of names
- will want to cycle though these files and parse out important variables (parsing.sh) 
/small_1000/ this is the msprime simulations for the 12 starting points for the 1000 gen project
/used_for_test_or_1000_gen/ msprime simulations for testing and the first sections of the 1000 gen project

MSprome_sim_1000/ Place where the MSprime 1000gen simulations will go 
each one of these was used in just one slim simulation (with the same corresponding values)

Old_1000_try/
/pheno_test_1000/ txt files and tress files to see what the phenotypes are after 1000 generations
This test was done with a specific MSprime simulation both_su_1e-10_nu_1e-10_sue_0.01_nue_0.01.init.trees
Next step clean slim text data and graph
/pheno_test_1000_2/ txt files and tress files to see what the phenotypes are after 1000 generations
This test was done different MSprime simulations 
Next step clean slim text data and graph

peter_sug_1000/ this is just a slight change in the 1on1 slim script 7/19/2021
Peter made a suggestion for how to do the mutation rate for newts and snakes and total
I am rerunning the 12 msprime and 143 slim simulations to see how the results differ.

pheno_test_1000/ t files and tress files to see what the phenotypes are after 1000 generations for the simulations with different msprimes
BUT I couldn't tell them apart so I redid the experiment in a new folder -> pheno_test_1000_12

pheno_test_1000_12/ txt files and tress files to see what the phenotypes are after 1000 generations for the simulations with different msprimes
a little bit more than 1000 different simulations. 143 slim simulations for 12 msprime simulations

pheno_test_1000_cut/ this is where the "cut" files go.
I just wanted a place to hold all the data after I got rid of the extra text
thinking about deleting it
mostly a copy of the experiments that I ran
/text_files/ files from the 12 msprime simulation that were unidentifiable 
/text_files_12/ files from the 12 msprime simulation that were identifiable 


SLiM_script/ has the 1 on 1 slim script. Where I was testing mutation rate and effect size.
/job_out/ place where the output and the errs go from jobs (its too larger now, dump? or fix?)
data_cut - makes new folders and sut out the extra info from slim scrips
newt_snake_1on1.slim - 2d next on snake, no deleterious mutations or fitness cost
parsing_1000_small.srun - for and a while loop that goes through a file and runs the parameters from a csv while using the all the msprime simulations from a folder (must include the folder when running)
parsing.srun - pulling out values from names of a folder
pheno_test_1000.srun - calls the slim script with variables given from a file <- I made this to see what the phenotypes are after 1000 generations
runslim.srun - runs the slim script with the variables passed through a different script (one of the most used files)
slim_test_script.srun - file to run just one test file to check if slim & other stuff is working
slimloop.srun - loops through variables and calls another script to run the slim script
slimtestvarables_short.csv - place for the variables that I wish to test condensed version
slimtestvarables.csv - place for the variables that I wish to test all possible combinations




GIT/MY FILES:

data/ <- will never be pushed to git
slimtestvarables.csv  - contains the variables for the 1000 gens experiment 
csv_files/ large_eff/ sigma/ size/ 2d_size/ Contains the data from the matching phenotypes 3rd rotation experiment 

figures/ that I used in my rotation talks to explain how similar the two populations were

graphs_newt_snakes/ r markdown files to show the results from the newt snake experiment
Expected_results_fig.Rmd - proposal expected results (might have some good graph info) 
fig_1000.Rmd - this is the r markdown for the 1000 generation experiment. As of 7/7/2021 there are 3 experiments (mistake experiment, experiment 1 and two simulation experiment)
    there are some question I have about the slim and msprim script, like why do the newts start out higher? I will look into the msprime and sslim script to see what might be going on
	As of 7/14/2021 There has been a forth experiment added. This experiment is called the 12 starting points and is explained in detal on the r markdown file
find_params.Rmd - After the 1000 generation experiment Peter and I did some path to see if the phenotypes I got were expected
	Spoiler: They were! Now (7/19/2021) I am looking at what parameters will result in phenotypes around 2 or 5  

Help_Files/ Files like this one for the different directories and scripts and experiments that I do!
explanation.txt - this file (1000 generation focused my split into 3 files for cluster/git/experiments)

msprime/ the genetic variation simulations
snake_newt_gv_.py <- making the standing genetic variation for the slim script for both the newt and the snake
newt_gen_diversity.py <- making the standing genetic variation for the newt
snake_gen_diversity.py <- making the standing genetic variation for the snake
merge_snake_newt.py <- combining the stand alones into one file (many problems currently 6/18/21)

newt_snake/ <- my slim scripts about coevoultion
nospace.slim - slim coevolution simulation without space
newt_snake_1on1.slim - newt on snake coevolution in 2d

python_script/ many of these scripts are for tests and animating the bias mig ancestry  
python_test.py - testing the exponential and normal distributions 
ofspring_by_ind.py - solved the problem of children being miss-counted (WORKING WELL) 
ofspring_percentage.py - makes the circles more even (WORKING WELL) 
whyTypeError.py - figuring out why there is this error
tv_path_percentage.py - trying to caculate the paths but something is wrong
offspring_through_time.py - finding the number of offspring though time dots got larger as the number off offspring grew (something not right)
offspring_links.py - finding the links between individuals 
split_offsring_tt.py - did this the hard way with loops tring to find all of the kids of parents, much better to make and fill a matrix
animat_scatter.py - test for animation dots move and change sizes 
treesee.py - first attempt at animating and would get infinite loops (do not run)
curious.py - made a short video of 100 generations with all of the individuals in the simulation lines traced the location of individuals from 1 individual PC 

R_script/ these are to make the figures for the rotation talk they do have the name split information that i will use for my newts and snakes

slim_script/ scriptss from summer 2020 when i was first learning about coevoultion

EXPERIMENTS: 

Current:
newt_snake_1on1.slim leads to giant phenotype levels like millions to 0s 6/10/21
- Is this because of space or the interaction. Possibly both?
- Try to make a slim script with no space (nospace.slim) 6/18/21 NPH
- Try to make a slim script with no coevolution
- Try to make a slim script with no space and no coevolution
Potential solutions:
- Deleterious mutations 
- Add fitness cost

1000 Generation experiment aims to identify why some of the phenotypes seems to be extreme 
- 1 msprime with switched mu and sd for 143 slim simulations
- 1 msprime with corrected mu and sd for 143 slim simulations
- 1 msprime for each slim simulation (each parameter values match in both simulations)
- 12 starting points. There are 12 msprime simulations where each of these simulations will used to start 143 slim simulations (note Newts and Snakes will start off equally)
- Peters slim suggestion (fix the total mutation rate and took at the ratio) - currently running

GOALS:
- Learn how to use snakemake
- Rest after teaching
