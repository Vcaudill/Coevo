This is a guide to help me remember what I have done and the explanation/results

Naming guide: Try to name files with important variables and an ID 
SLiM - variable names/values separated with _ and the ID of the slim simulation
MSprime - variable names/values separated with _ (need to add ID)

GIT/MY FILES:

data/ <- will never be pushed to git
slimtestvarables.csv  - contains the variables for the 1000 gens experiment 
csv_files/ large_eff/ sigma/ size/ 2d_size/ Contains the data from the matching phenotypes 3rd rotation experiment 

figures/ that I used in my rotation talks to explain how similar the two populations were

graphs_newt_snakes/ r markdown files to show the results from the newt snake experiment
Expected_results_fig.Rmd - proposal expected results (might have some good graph info) 
fig_1000.Rmd - this is the r markdown for the 1000 generation experiment. As of 7/7/2021 there are 3 experiments (mistake experiment, experiment 1 and two simulation experiment)
    there are some question I have about the slim and msprim script, like why do the newts start out higher? I will look into the msprime and sslim script to see what might be going on
	As of 7/14/2021 There has been a forth experiment added. This experiment is called the 12 starting points and is explained in detal on the r markdown file
find_params.Rmd - After the 1000 generation experiment Peter and I did some path to see if the phenotypes I got were expected
	Spoiler: They were! Now (7/19/2021) I am looking at what parameters will result in phenotypes around 2 or 5  

Help_Files/ Files like this one for the different directories and scripts and experiments that I do!
explanation.txt - this file (1000 generation focused my split into 3 files for cluster/git/experiments)

msprime/ the genetic variation simulations
snake_newt_gv_.py <- making the standing genetic variation for the slim script for both the newt and the snake
newt_gen_diversity.py <- making the standing genetic variation for the newt
snake_gen_diversity.py <- making the standing genetic variation for the snake
merge_snake_newt.py <- combining the stand alones into one file (many problems currently 6/18/21)

msprime_explore/ figuring out how to make msprime work
	 
newt_snake/ <- my slim scripts about coevoultion
nospace.slim - slim coevolution simulation without space
newt_snake_1on1.slim - newt on snake coevolution in 2d 
newt_vs_snake.slim - trial that I dont really use any more
data/ <- tree files produced from slim while in testing mode (will not be on git)

python_script/ many of these scripts are for tests and animating the bias mig ancestry  
python_test.py - testing the exponential and normal distributions 
ofspring_by_ind.py - solved the problem of children being miss-counted (WORKING WELL) 
ofspring_percentage.py - makes the circles more even (WORKING WELL) 
whyTypeError.py - figuring out why there is this error
tv_path_percentage.py - trying to caculate the paths but something is wrong
offspring_through_time.py - finding the number of offspring though time dots got larger as the number off offspring grew (something not right)
offspring_links.py - finding the links between individuals 
split_offsring_tt.py - did this the hard way with loops tring to find all of the kids of parents, much better to make and fill a matrix
animat_scatter.py - test for animation dots move and change sizes 
treesee.py - first attempt at animating and would get infinite loops (do not run)
curious.py - made a short video of 100 generations with all of the individuals in the simulation lines traced the location of individuals from 1 individual PC 

R_script/ these are to make the figures for the rotation talk they do have the name split information that i will use for my newts and snakes

slim_script/ scriptss from summer 2020 when i was first learning about coevoultion
phe_sel_virus_n_host_2d.slim - tracking number of mutations in 2d (x mutation 1 and y mutation2) seems like a gene for gene model
trackall_test.slim - how to remember all individuals in a slim script bias mig
phe_sel_virus_n_host.slim - tracking number of mutations for a gene for gene model
large_effect.slim - virus and host tracking each other if there were large mutation effects
large_small_2d.slim - how would the tracking be implicated if the effects were different for 2 mutations?

srun_scripts/ files for the cluster
msprimeloop1000.srun - loops though variables from a file and calls another script to run the simulation
msprimeloop.srun - loops though variables and calls another script to run the simulation
pheno_test_1000.srun  - calls the slim script with variables given from a file 
slimfill.sh - practice pulling variables from a csv file
parsing.sh - practice pulling variables from a file name
pheno_test_1000.srun - practice making directories and looping though values in a csv
slimloop.srun - loops through variables and calls another script to run the slim script
runslim.srun - runs the slim script with the variables passed through a different script
runsllim.txt - practice for running slim with variables passed from another script
pheno_test_1000.srun - practice for parsing simulation vales from msprime name
testloop.sh - - practice for looping variables to pass to another script
runmsprime.srun - runs the msprime simulation




EXPERIMENTS: 

Current:
newt_snake_1on1.slim leads to giant phenotype levels like millions to 0s 6/10/21
- Is this because of space or the interaction. Possibly both?
- Try to make a slim script with no space (nospace.slim) 6/18/21 NPH
- Try to make a slim script with no coevolution
- Try to make a slim script with no space and no coevolution
Potential solutions:
- Deleterious mutations 
- Add fitness cost

1000 Generation experiment aims to identify why some of the phenotypes seems to be extreme 
- 1 msprime with switched mu and sd for 143 slim simulations
- 1 msprime with corrected mu and sd for 143 slim simulations
- 1 msprime for each slim simulation (each parameter values match in both simulations)
- 12 starting points. There are 12 msprime simulations where each of these simulations will used to start 143 slim simulations (note Newts and Snakes will start off equally)
- Peters slim suggestion (fix the total mutation rate and took at the ratio) - currently running

GOALS:
- Learn how to use snakemake
- Rest after teaching
