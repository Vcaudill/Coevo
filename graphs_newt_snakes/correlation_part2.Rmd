## Comparing newt and snake phenotype correlation

newt and snake data from Hanifin et al. 2008

```{r, reak data cor}
snewt <- read.csv("~/Desktop/snake_newt_real_data.csv", header = TRUE)
snewt$mean_res = snewt$mean_toxin+snewt$dif
cor(snewt$mean_toxin, snewt$mean_res)

```


## More data from the slim simulation 

might be a specific generation or a small set of generations, If I can get the data to be saved and then interpreted by R
make a list in a coulmn 
how to proporsion and recreate what I see in the slim map (the different box and their dims)
