## Purpose

Here I am doing a small experiment to compare different genetic architectures between snakes and newts. I will use the cost_1on1 simulation and my snake_newt_gv msprime simulation. 

Outline

-Pick 4 different mu sigma combinations where mu*sigma^2 is constant (mu=1e-11, sigma=5) to (mu=1e-8, sigma=0.005) i.e (mu=1e-11, sigma=5, mu=1e-10, sigma=0.5, mu=1e-9, sigma=0.05 mu=1e-8, sigma=0.005)
-In total that will be 16 msprime simulations and 16 slim simulations
-make a co-evolutionary heatmap


Started to run msprim simulations on cluster
